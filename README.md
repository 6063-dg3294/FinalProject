# Week 2
This week, I put my efforts on how to make the serial connection. I started by learning the Serial tutorial. In the meantime, I added more research into the documentation - Idea 1 Development (https://pepper-minute-d06.notion.site/Week-11-db2a3223915546ea96b4f5be9b1ca038?pvs=4). I learned examples on creating physical keyboards and began thinking do I need a final real keycap.

I tried to follow the tutorial to try out the connection itself. In the process, I encountered bugs like don't have the serial monitor on at the same time of using the browser.

After the successful connection, I wanted to build visuals that would inspire the final idea of releasing anxiety. I love butterflies and the metaphor they represent lately. I wrote circles which sizes are controlled by the photosenser to form the wings of butterflies. Here's the effect:

It looked pretty ugly. 
  
So, I drew a previz on colorful circles and squares to spread out the space instead of crawling in the center.

By creating a circle array and a rectangle array, I put all shapes in a uniform, random position that responded to the amount of light detected. A vivid, inspiring image would be adjustable by playing with the photosensor. I like the pixel art feeling it created.

# Week 1
For starters, I looked into the projects online. I keep the research sources here: https://pepper-minute-d06.notion.site/Week-11-db2a3223915546ea96b4f5be9b1ca038?pvs=4   
  
## 1. The Anxiety keyboard
Inspired by the breathing project, I want to create projects that can reflect one's physical movements. The first idea I have is a mini keyboard.

Input: physical
  
Output: p5
  
The user can click the keyboard when they feel anxious. I got the idea becuase when I feel like stucking in the moment, I like having something near me to click. The p5 can either generate random art or random inspirational notes.


## 2. The audio reative device 
![image description](./2.PNG)
Inspired by the audio examples I saw, maybe I could do a physical device to control both the shape and audio on p5. 
Input: physical  
  
Output: p5
  

## 3. A LED color-changing hat
![image description](./3.PNG)
Input: p5
  
Output: physical
  
Inspired by Adobe's real-time interactive dress (https://people.com/adobe-debuts-interactive-dress-8358152), I thought of combining fashion and intereactive visuals. The barrier I can think of for now is the amount of LEDs to make a big project and how can one Arduino chip hold that. Also, what can p5 do in this case?
