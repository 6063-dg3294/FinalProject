For starters, I looked into the projects online. I keep the research sources here: https://pepper-minute-d06.notion.site/Week-11-db2a3223915546ea96b4f5be9b1ca038?pvs=4   
  
## 1. The Anxiety keyboard
Inspired by the breathing project, I want to create projects that can reflect one's physical movements. The first idea I have is a mini keyboard.

Input: physical
  
Output: p5
  
The user can click the keyboard when they feel anxious. I got the idea becuase when I feel like stucking in the moment, I like having something near me to click. The p5 can either generate random art or random inspirational notes.


## 2. The audio reative device 
![image description](./2.PNG)
Inspired by the audio examples I saw, maybe I could do a physical device to control both the shape and audio on p5. 
Input: physical  
  
Output: p5
  

## 3. A LED color-changing hat

Input: physical  
  
Output: p5 
  
Inspired by Adobe's real-time interactive dress (https://people.com/adobe-debuts-interactive-dress-8358152), I thought of combining fashion and intereactive visuals. The barrier I can think of for now is the amount of LEDs to make a big project and how can one Arduino chip hold that. Also, what can p5 do in this case?
